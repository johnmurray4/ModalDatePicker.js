            <h1>Reusable Modal Date Picker</h1>
            <h2>John Murray</h2>
            <h3>
                The component that I have created is a reusable framework to build a modal date picker. It includes a button that displays the 
                selected date (today by default), and when the button is clicked opens up a modal containing a calendar. The user can select 
                any date from the calendar as well as navigate between different months and years. The component will keep the dates and weekdays aligned 
                properly.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                The component also accepts several optional parameters (nested in the single params object) such as width, height, headerColor, bodyColor,
                font, and highlight. These optional parameters allow for additional styling to fit your visual needs or preferences.

                This project required a lot of planning and careful naming of each variable. It took me a while to figure out how to properly display the days in alignment 
                with the correct weekdays. Here is the algorithm that I came up with to calculate it: 
            </h3>
            <div>
                  <pre style="font-size: 20px">
                    // Returns number of days in month
                            function daysInMonth(month, year) {
                                    let date = new Date(year, month+1, 0);
                                    return date.getDate();
                            }

                    //  Returns first day of week (0-6)
                            function loadCalendarDays(month, year) {
                                    var date = new Date(year, month, 1);
                                    var dayofweek = date.getDay();      
                                    return dayofweek + 1;
                            }

                            var firstWeekday = loadCalendarDays(selectedMonth, selectedYear);
                </pre>
            </div>
        </div>
    </body>
