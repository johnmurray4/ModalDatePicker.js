# ModalDatePicker.js
A reusable framework to build a custom modal datepicker element. It includes a button that displays the selected date (today by default), and when 
the button is clicked opens up a modal containing a calendar. The user can select any date from the calendar as well as navigate between different months and years. 
The component will keep the dates and weekdays aligned properly.
The component also accepts several optional parameters (nested in the single params object) such as width, height, headerColor, bodyColor, font, and highlight. 
These optional parameters allow for additional styling to fit your visual needs or preferences.
